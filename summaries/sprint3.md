# Summary for week n

## Alessio

This week, I implemented a graphical admin hub, so that the event committe can have access to the management features directly and adapt tests in consequences. 

My time estimates were good, this time I almost underestimates the time needed to create the UI. 

Next week, I will probably take a mix of backend and graphical tasks so that I can keep the good balance I have between backend and UI.
