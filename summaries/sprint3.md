# Summary for week n

## Alessio

This week, I implemented a graphical admin hub, so that the event committe can have access to the management features directly. I also adapted tests in consequences. 

This time, my time estimates were really good. 

Next week, I will probably take a mix of backend and graphical tasks so that I can keep the good balance I have between backend and UI.

## Overall team

Unfortunately, not all the user stories could have been fully implemented. Some of them will require one more week to be finished and fully tested. This week we had a mix between good and bad time estimates. 

The main reason for bad estimates is that half of the team switch to UI to backend and vice-versa, so that we had to learn new things and this tooks a long time. The tests still take a long time.  

This week, we did two stand-up meetings, one on Monday and another on Wednesday. The whole team was present. We still communicate a lot through our discord server during the week.

Nevertheless, we come up with some major improvement this week and people help each other when needed, which is great. I think the team is on the right track.
