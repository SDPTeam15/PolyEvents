# Summary for week 3

## Alessio

This week, I implemented a graphical admin hub, so that the event committe can have access to the management features directly. I also adapted tests in consequences.

This time, my time estimates were really good.

Next week, I will probably take a mix of backend and graphical tasks so that I can keep the good balance I have between backend and UI.

## Cyrille
So this week I added a location feature on the map. The user can enable/disable the use of its location and can center the map on the current location. However as it is a feature that is closely related to Google Map, I did not wrote tests for it. This will probably be done in the next sprint.

My time estimate was fairly good.

Next week, some tests for the location need to be written. If possible, I would rather some more backend as the location feature was a bit UI related too.

## Mathieu

This week, I added the possibility to add an area to the map, move the area and change its size while creating it. I also added the two buttons to add and save the area. I wasn't able to write the tests for these functionalities due to lack of time and because it is related to Google Map. I refactored the google map code written these two last weeks.

My time estimate was too short to write the tests to all these functionality. But what took a long time(which was not planned) to fix was to find a way to pass the cirrius tests.

Next week, I will write the tests that are missing this week. I would like also to add a button to modify the shape and position of an area and the rotation of the area.

## Overall team

Unfortunately, not all the user stories could have been fully implemented. Some of them will require one more week to be finished and fully tested. This week we had a mix between good and bad time estimates.

The main reason for bad estimates is that half of the team switch to UI to backend and vice-versa, so that we had to learn new things and this tooks a long time. The tests still take a long time.  

This week, we did two stand-up meetings, one on Monday and another on Wednesday. The whole team was present. We still communicate a lot through our discord server during the week.

Nevertheless, we come up with some major improvement this week and people help each other when needed, which is great. I think the team is on the right track.
