# Summary for week 2

## Alessio

I implemented the database interface as well as methods used to update profile information, register in database and get the informations back.

My time estimates were good to learn how to use Firebase and also how to implement the communication for the user information. Once again, I strictly underestimate the time needed to do the tests.

As this pattern of communication will be repeated many times during the project, we wanted to have a strong pattern and this takes time to think about.

Next week, I'll probably take some more graphical tasks because I was mainly doing backend until now and I should work with UI also.

## Cyrille (Scrum Master)
I refactored all the Activity stuff into Event stuff to avoid confusion with the android Activity. Then I implemented a UI page for events providers to request some items/material to the admins.

My time estimate for the refactoring was quite ok but the one for the UI items requests was too low (not enough time). The functionality was implemented in the estimated time but the tests for the UI, with somewhat nested layouts, took much longer. So in the end it took me longer than estimated. Also if we want to do "good" PR review this take some time.

Next week, I will try to take a task more related to the backend as I did not do much of it during last weeks.

## Florian

I added the admin UI to allow them to see what items are in the database. They can add new items and delete existing ones from this one.

I spent more time than expected to do my part because of the tests. I spent too much time reading the documentation to understand some part of the test libraries.

Next week, I'll try to take more backend tasks as I only worked on UI until now.

## Mathieu

This week, I set the google map fragment up and explorated the features it offers. I created a function to draw areas and add the information window related to it.

My time estimate to set google map up was a bit too long because everything went right on the first try. Then for the part exploring the google map features, I put an estimated time but didn't try to follow it as I was experimenting and always wanted to implement more. Also, I looked for a way to test the clickListeners for google map for some time but didn't really succeed, which took some more time.

Next week, I will take a backend developping task to do more programming. 

## Robin

I implemented the Observable, ObservableList and Observer classes to avoid issues due to MutableLiveData, then FakeDatabase for risked tests which would need a database.

My time estimates were quite good for the first part, but for the second I over estimate the time so I helped the others for the testing part.

Next week, I'll take a graphical tasks. I have done only backend until there so it will be good to do some UI.

## Stephane

## Overall team
Approximately all the user stories selected for this sprint were implemented. Some will take more time to fully implement their functionality, such as the online database. But a great job was done during the week !

Our time estimates are slightly better (less worse) than last week. We still underestimate vastly the time of tests and PR reviews etc in my opinion. This introduce some frustration as we can feel that we don't do much in terms of new features but pass a lot of time doing tests. This comes from the fact that we are often stuck when trying to test some feature.

We only did 1 "official" standup meeting this week on Monday evening. This was enough because we communicate a lot on our discord server. Therefore we are directly aware if something is going wrong.
