# Summary for week 2

## Alessio

I implemented the database interface as well as methods used to update profile information, register in database and get the informations back. 

My time estimates were good to learn how to use Firebase and also how to implement the communication for the user information. Once again, I strictly underestimate the time needed to do the tests. 

As this pattern of communication will be repeated many times during the project, we wanted to have a strong pattern and this takes time to think about. 

Next week, I'll probably take some more graphical tasks because I was mainly doing backend until now and I should work with UI also.

This week, I set the google map fragment up and explorated the features it offers. I created a function to draw areas and add the information window related to it.

My time estimate to set google map up was a bit too long because everything went right on the first try. Then for the part exploring the google map features, I put an estimated time but didn't try to follow it as I was experimenting and always wanted to implement more. Also, I looked for a way to test the clickListeners for google map for some time but didn't really succeed, which took some more time.

Next week, I will take a backend developping task to do more programming. 

## Robin

I implemented the Observable, ObservableList and Observer classes to avoid issues due to MutableLiveData, then FakeDatabase for risked tests which would need a database.

My time estimates were quite good for the first part, but for the second I over estimate the time so I helped the others for the testing part.

Next week, I'll take a graphical tasks. I have done only backend until there so it will be good to do some UI.
