# Summary for week 2

## Alessio

I implemented the database interface as well as methods used to update profile information, register in database and get the informations back. 

My time estimates were good to learn how to use Firebase and also how to implement the communication for the user information. Once again, I strictly underestimate the time needed to do the tests. 

As this pattern of communication will be repeated many times during the project, we wanted to have a strong pattern and this takes time to think about. 

Next week, I'll probably take some mroe graphical tasks because I was mainly doing backend until now and I should work with UI also.
