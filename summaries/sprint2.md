# Summary for week 2

## Alessio

I implemented the database interface as well as methods used to update profile information, register in database and get the informations back.

My time estimates were good to learn how to use Firebase and also how to implement the communication for the user information. Once again, I strictly underestimate the time needed to do the tests.

As this pattern of communication will be repeated many times during the project, we wanted to have a strong pattern and this takes time to think about.

Next week, I'll probably take some more graphical tasks because I was mainly doing backend until now and I should work with UI also.

## Cyrille (Scrum Master)
I refactored all the Activity stuff into Event stuff to avoid confusion with the android Activity. Then I implemented a UI page for events providers to request some items/material to the admins.

My time estimate for the refactoring was quite ok but the one for the UI items requests was too low (not enough time). The functionality was implemented in the estimated time but the tests for the UI, with somewhat nested layouts, took much longer. So in the end it took me longer than estimated. Also if we want to do "good" PR review this take some time.

Next week, I will try to take a task more related to the backend as I did not do much of it during last weeks.

I implemented the Observable, ObservableList and Observer classes to avoid issues due to MutableLiveData, then FakeDatabase for risked tests which would need a database.

My time estimates were quite good for the first part, but for the second I over estimate the time so I helped the others for the testing part.

Next week, I'll take a graphical tasks. I have done only backend until there so it will be good to do some UI.
