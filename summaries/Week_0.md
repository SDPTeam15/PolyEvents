# Summary for week 0

I implemented a class to describe an Activity (in the event sense, will need to rename this). Also, I designed a small layout to display a summary of an activity as a "card" and add some stubs activities to the home page.

My time estimate was for the activity class was somewhat good (a bit too short) but my estimate for the UI activity card was too short. It is mainly because of some problems to test the UI for the upcoming activities on the homepage.

Next time, I will split the functionalities in more branches so that the PR can be easily reviewed and merged earlier during the week so that others can use my code (or at least its interface) if needed.

I implemented a adapter de la classe given by google for firebase witch will be used in the rest of the application as for permissions.

The estimated time was too low, I did not foresee issues with the tests and the documentation.
