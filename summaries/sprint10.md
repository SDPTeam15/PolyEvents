# Summary for week 10

## Alessio
This week I implemented the event edit request activity so that an event organiser can propose an event edit. My time estimates were really good this week and I had to time one or two bugs as well as helping some of the team mates. 

Next week, I will focus on fixing bugs to get the app ready for next Friday.


## Florian 
This week I implementd the material request management for staffs, so they can take in charge item requests and deliver them to event providers

My time estitmates where a bit too optimistic, as I didn't take some aspects of my task into account when assigning the task, for example to allow staffs to return items after event providers finished to use them.

Next week, I will focus on all the remaining tasks we have to do for the last sprint.

## Mathieu

This week, I implemented the timetable for the visitors so that they can see events that happen on a certain day an zone. 

My time estimate were good, I was scared it would take me more time but it turned out not so complicated.

Next week, I will focus on bug fix and enhancement for the app to prepare it for the final presentation.

## Robin
This week I add a generic local cash and an implementation for RouteDatabase in FirestoreDatabaseProvider.

I underestimate the time of work, it was due to the age differences between Firestore and Room.

Next week, I will fix some reminder bugs.

## Stephane
This week I implemented the follow event functionality, as well as receiving notifications when you 
subscribe or follow an event, so that you can get notified even when you don't have the app open.

This week's task took a lot more time. The follow event functionality did not take a lot of time (1 or 2 hours)
but the notifications needed a lot more time (10 or so hours) because I was unfamiliar with background services
and the notification API. But I pushed through and did the extra hours, because we deemed it an important functionality.

Next week, I will focus on the last small remaining tasks, as well as fixing bugs to get the app ready.

## Overall team
Overall, most of the tasks assigned this week were done, even some difficult ones. We had 2 weekly meetings, 
but a lot more meetings happened between people needing help from each other. Team dynamic is still very good
and we're getting ready for the last to fix the bugs and release the app.
