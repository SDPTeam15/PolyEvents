# Summary for week 10

## Alessio

## Florian 

## Mathieu

## Robin

## Stephane
This week I implemented the follow event functionality, as well as receiving notifications when you 
subscribe or follow an event, so that you can get notified even when you don't have the app open.

This week's task took a lot more time. The follow event functionality did not take a lot of time (1 or 2 hours)
but the notifications needed a lot more time (10 or so hours) because I was unfamiliar with background services
and the notification API. But I pushed through and did the extra hours, because we deemed it an important functionality.

Next week, I will focus on the last small remaining tasks, as well as fixing bugs to get the app ready.

## Overall team
Overall, most of the tasks assigned this week were done, even some difficult ones. We had 2 weekly meetings, 
but a lot more meetings happened between people needing help from each other. Team dynamic is still very good
and we're getting ready for the last to fix the bugs and release the app.
