# Summary for week 8

## Alessio

## Florian 
This week I implemented an algorithm that merges our rectangular areas together as a zones with holes inside. 

I underestimated the time needed to implement it, as I didn't notice at first the number of special cases to take into account.

Next week I will focus on material requests and add a functionality to accept or refuse requests.
