# Summary for week 8

## Alessio
This week, I made the communication between the database and the rating feature on the application. Since I had a bit of time left, I also made a small refactor of the Event datbabse.

My time estimate were good!

Next week, I will display the list of event per Zone so that the admin can easily update or delete an event. 

## Florian 
This week I implemented an algorithm that merges our rectangular areas together as a zones with holes inside. 

I underestimated the time needed to implement it, as I didn't notice at first the number of special cases to take into account.

Next week I will focus on material requests and add a functionality to accept or refuse requests.

## Mathieu

## Robin

## Stephane

## Overall team

This week, all team member finish their tasks on time with over all great timee estimates. The destabilisation tasks were splits between three people: Alessio, Mathieu and Stephane. We did this all the Friday afternoon and a great collaboration was done between the three of us. Florian and Robin also collaborate to finish their tasks. It's great to see such a team work!

We had, two standup meetings, one on Monday and one on Wednesday. Except Florian that needs a bit of help with its hardcore task (Mathieu and Robin helped him), nobody had noticeable problems.
