# Summary for week 8

## Alessio
This week, I made the communication between the database and the rating feature on the application. Since I had a bit of time left, I also made a small refactor of the Event datbabse.

My time estimate were good!

Next week, I will display the list of event per Zone so that the admin can easily update or delete an event. 

## Florian 
This week I implemented an algorithm that merges our rectangular areas together as a zones with holes inside. 

I underestimated the time needed to implement it, as I didn't notice at first the number of special cases to take into account.

Next week I will focus on material requests and add a functionality to accept or refuse requests.

## Mathieu

This week, I implemented the part that displays comments and the rating of an event on its activity.

I also did a refactor of GoogleMapHelper.

My time estimate was ok, displaying the ratings was a bit easier than I expected and I used this time to do a bigger refactor.

Next week, I will work on the Item requests, to see the state of an item request.

## Robin

## Stephane
This week, I implemented the leave review and rating on an event functionality. I did not implement the user settings tab that should
replace the More tab until we figure out where to put the buttons in the More fragment. Instead I spent some time looking
into the MapFragment to prepare for next week's sprint.

My time estimates were good for the leave review functionality. Testing took an extra hour or so, 
because I introduced new testing dependencies in the gradle for testing fragments, that took some getting used to.

Next week, I will display the events per zone when clicked upon in the map.

## Overall team

This week, all team member finish their tasks on time with over all great timee estimates. The destabilisation tasks were splits between three people: Alessio, Mathieu and Stephane. We did this all the Friday afternoon and a great collaboration was done between the three of us. Florian and Robin also collaborate to finish their tasks. It's great to see such a team work!

We had, two standup meetings, one on Monday and one on Wednesday. Except Florian that needs a bit of help with its hardcore task (Mathieu and Robin helped him), nobody had noticeable problems.
