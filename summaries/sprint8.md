# Summary for week 8

## Alessio
This week, I made the communication between the database and the rating feature on the application. Since I had a bit of time left, I also made a small refactor of the Event datbabse.

My time estimate were good!

Next week, I will display the list of event per Zone so that the admin can easily update or delete an event. 

## Florian 
This week I implemented an algorithm that merges our rectangular areas together as a zones with holes inside. 

I underestimated the time needed to implement it, as I didn't notice at first the number of special cases to take into account.

Next week I will focus on material requests and add a functionality to accept or refuse requests.
