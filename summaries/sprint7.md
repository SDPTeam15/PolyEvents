# Summary for week n

## Alessio

This week I implemented the event creation and management activity so that the admin can graphically create or udpate events. 

My cumulative time estimate was good but if we look in details at each task, the time estimates were wrong. First of all, the time I estimated for the connection with the database was wrong beacuse the connection was already implemented and i didn't notice that. 
And for the other task, "the UI" was too low because I underestimated the time needed to write code that will check if every field has been correctly filled in. 

Next week, I will continue working on the event. I will create the list of all events so that the admin can quickly choose an event to update.

This week, I implemented storing the user preferences and settings into the local cache as well as syncing
the local database with the remote Firestore on user login.

This task took me around 8 hours which is what I estimated it would take. I took this week an easy task, to make sure
the local cache works and to test it well.

Next week, I will look into displaying the events in each zone of the map.
