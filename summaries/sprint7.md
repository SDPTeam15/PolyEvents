# Summary for week n

## Alessio

This week I implemented the event creation and management activity so that the admin can graphically create or udpate events. 

My cumulative time estimate was good but if we look in details at each task, the time estimates were wrong. First of all, the time I estimated for the connection with the database was wrong beacuse the connection was already implemented and i didn't notice that. 
And for the other task, "the UI" was too low because I underestimated the time needed to write code that will check if every field has been correctly filled in. 

Next week, I will continue working on the event. I will create the list of all events so that the admin can quickly choose an event to update. 

## Florian 

## Mathieu

This week, I implemented the road creation on the map and the drawing of the shortest path.

My time estimate was good. I did not have any particular problem this week.

The collaboration with Robin and Florian went smoothly.

Next week, I will continue to have a great time estimate.

## Robin
This week, I implemented storing the backend for the route feature and added more generic fonction for the DB.

It take 10 hours do do all the tastk, this is due to the preparation we do in common with Florian and Mathieu to not have to much issue with the merge.

Next week, I will do the intersection between a edge and an area more useful for admin.

## Stephane
This week, I implemented storing the user preferences and settings into the local cache as well as syncing
the local database with the remote Firestore on user login.

This task took me around 8 hours which is what I estimated it would take. I took this week an easy task, to make sure
the local cache works and to test it well.

Next week, I will look into displaying the events in each zone of the map.
