# Summary for week n

## Alessio
This week I made a refactor according to the comments by the TA including some database refactor. 

I under-estimate a bit the time needed to fix the tests once the refactor is done. 

Next week I will work on the admin side, to display the list of all user so that the admin can have access to the information of the user and his profile list (to promote/demote him)
