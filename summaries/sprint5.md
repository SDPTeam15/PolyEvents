# Summary for week 5

## Alessio
This week I made a refactor according to the comments by the TA including some database refactor. 

I under-estimate a bit the time needed to fix the tests once the refactor is done. 

Next week I will work on the admin side, to display the list of all user so that the admin can have access to the information of the user and his profile list (to promote/demote him)

## Stephane (Scrum Master)
This week I implemented the user registration to activities in an event. 

My times estimates were generally good, the task was simple. It took some additional time to get used to the UI tests,
since this was my first frontend task. But any extra time is accounted for to make up for the time I didn't do
during last sprint.

Next week, I will look into the local cache using Android Room and saving the events the user will attend 
on it.

## Overall team
Overall, everyone did their tasks well and within the time. We managed to finish all the user stories
assigned to this sprint. We had 2 stand-up meetings to discuss any issues about the app and other.

Note that this is the first week where we work as 5 person team instead of 6 after the departure
of Cyrille. But luckily Cyrille wasn't working in isolation during the last sprints, so his work is 
not unfamiliar. Team spirit is still strong and work is ongoing to deliver something good.
