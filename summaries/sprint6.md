# Summary for week 6

# Alessio 

This week, I implemented the user list for the admin so that they can choose to click on some user, see his details and eventually promote/demote him. 

My time estimates were good for both task.

Next week, I will create the UI interface to create and manage event. 

# Stephane
This week, I implemented the local cache using Room database, to store events to which the user has registered.

I've clearly underestimated the time needed for this task, because I had to read documentation not only on Room, but on 
coroutines and viewmodel. I've spent about double the amount of time of what I assigned to this task, because of tests
as well.

Next week, I'll spend some more time on the local cache, storing other information and doing more tests.

This week, I implemented the Item requests feature of the app. It enables event providers to send the requests to the admins and they all appear on the admin hub. 

My time estimates were good for both tasks, and I spend extra time on redesigning the material request activity.

Next week, I will work a bit on the map, as I didn't work much on that part of the app.
