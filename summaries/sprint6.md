# Summary for week 6

# Alessio 

This week, I implemented the user list for the admin so that they can choose to click on some user, see his details and eventually promote/demote him. 

My time estimates were good for both task.

Next week, I will create the UI interface to create and manage event.

This week, I implemented the local cache using Room database, to store events to which the user has registered.

I've clearly underestimated the time needed for this task, because I had to read documentation not only on Room, but on 
coroutines and viewmodel. I've spent about double the amount of time of what I assigned to this task, because of tests
as well.

Next week, I'll spend some more time on the local cache, storing other information and doing more tests.
