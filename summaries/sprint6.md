# Summary for week 6

# Alessio 

This week, I implemented the user list for the admin so that they can choose to click on some user, see his details and eventually promote/demote him. 

My time estimates were good for both task.

Next week, I will create the UI interface to create and manage event. 

# Stephane
This week, I implemented the local cache using Room database, to store events to which the user has registered.

I've clearly underestimated the time needed for this task, because I had to read documentation not only on Room, but on 
coroutines and viewmodel. I've spent about double the amount of time of what I assigned to this task, because of tests
as well.

Next week, I'll spend some more time on the local cache, storing other information and doing more tests.

# Florian

This week, I implemented the Item requests feature of the app. It enables event providers to send the requests to the admins and they all appear on the admin hub. 

My time estimates were good for both tasks, and I spend extra time on redesigning the material request activity.

Next week, I will work a bit on the map, as I didn't work much on that part of the app.

# Robin

This week, I implemented the heatmap and a routine to send the position of the device to the db. And in bonus ObservableMap.

My time estimates were good for my tasks, and I spend extra time on ObservableMap just for my fun.

Next week, I will work a path finding feature.

# Mathieu (Scrum Master)

This week, I implemented the modification of an item after having creating it.

My time estimates were were not accurate for this week. The correction of the tests for the task of last sprint took more time that I imagined, but the modification of the items took less time than I planned because most of the functions I needed were already implemented and I didn't know it when I took the task.

Next week, I will work on the path finding with my lovely team members :=)

## Overall team

Overall, everyone did their tasks well and within the time limit. We managed to finish all the user stories we took for the sprint.

We had 2 stand-up meetings to discuss the problems encountered for some tasks and we also discussed about what we wanted to do in the next sprint to compleate the requirements.
