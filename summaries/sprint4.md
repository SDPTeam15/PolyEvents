# Summary for week 4

## Alessio
In this two week sprint, I implemented an activity to create new zone and store them into the database. I also tested both the database queries and the UI.

my time estimates were good. I over estimate a bit (1 hour) the time needed to implement and test the database queries. I also under estimate a bit (2 hours) the time needed for the UI. So overall,

Next sprint, I will take into account the comments made by the TAs and do a refactoring of our code so that our team can work in a clean code base.

## Cyrille
During this long sprint, I implemented a feature that allows to rotate new areas in Google Map. I added some tests for the "my location" feature also in Google Map. Finally I added a function in the database to store a user location and one to retrieve all the users locations present in the db.

My time estimates for the queries to the db were good. However the rotation feature took me longer than expected (3h).

## Florian
During this sprint, I finished to implement the adaptation of our existing code with the observable type and the new Item type to make the view asynchronous and to be able to get querries from the database.

My time estimates were two low this week. It took me a long time to merge the work done on master and adapt the tests for every class that needed to and to create new tests.

Next sprint, I'll take a task using concepts I already know, like storing into the database and UI components that I'm already familiar with, so that I won't spend too much time reading the documentation.

## Mathieu

During this two-week sprint, I tested the GoogleMapHelper class, and I refactored its methods in order to do the tests. I also added the feature to modify an area after creating it.

My time estimate was quite ok. The tests took more time than expected because I had to do some refactoring to make the tests.

Next sprint, I will work a bit with the database and go on a bit with google map. 

## Robin
During this long sprint, I merging and testing the UserEntity with Stephane, I implemented a ObservableList and add a profiles list editor.

The estimated time was too low for the last part, so I will implemented the test for it next week.

## Stephane
During this sprint, I finally merged the model entities branch and fully tested it, so that the rest of code is consistent with these changes. 
I also spent some time looking at kotlin coroutines to maybe use in the database.

My time estimates for merging the model entities was a bit higher (2h) than expected, mainly because of tests. Looking at 
kotlin coroutines took about 3 or 4 hours. Needless to say, I haven't done my time quota for this sprint (missing about 8 hours), 
that I will try to catch up somehow in the upcoming weeks,

Next week, I'll tackle a front end feature like events to change a bit.
