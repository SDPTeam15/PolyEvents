# Summary for week 4

## Alessio
In this two week sprint, I implemented an activity to create new zone and store them into the database. I also tested both the database queries and the UI.

my time estimates were good. I over estimate a bit (1 hour) the time needed to implement and test the database queries. I also under estimate a bit (2 hours) the time needed for the UI. So overall,

Next sprint, I will take into account the comments made by the TAs and do a refactoring of our code so that our team can work in a clean code base.

## Cyrille
During this long sprint, I implemented a feature that allows to rotate new areas in Google Map. I added some tests for the "my location" feature also in Google Map. Finally I added a function in the database to store a user location and one to retrieve all the users locations present in the db.

My time estimates for the queries to the db were good. However the rotation feature took me longer than expected (3h).

## Florian

## Mathieu

During this two-week sprint, I tested the GoogleMapHelper class, and I refactored its methods in order to do the tests. I also added the feature to modify an area after creating it.

My time estimate was quite ok. The tests took more time than expected because I had to do some refactoring to make the tests.

Next sprint, I will work a bit with the database and go on a bit with google map.
