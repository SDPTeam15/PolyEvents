# Summary for week 1

## Alessio

I implemented the sign-in with Google system using FirebaseAuth. Two displayable fragment were created to handle login as well as displaying the basic user information. My time estimates were good only for implementing the Sign-In Authentication, i.e. the estimates didn't take into account the time needed to implement the tests. 

Next time, I'll probably take smaller tasks if they require to read a lot of documentation. 

## Cyrille

I implemented a class to describe an Activity (in the event sense, will need to rename this). Also, I designed a small layout to display a summary of an activity as a "card" and add some stubs activities to the home page.

My time estimate was for the activity class was somewhat good (a bit too short) but my estimate for the UI activity card was too short. It is mainly because of some problems to test the UI for the upcoming activities on the homepage.

Next time, I will split the functionalities in more branches so that the PR can be easily reviewed and merged earlier during the week so that others can use my code (or at least its interface) if needed.

## Mathieu

I implemented the UI for the mainActivity. It is composed of a Navigation bar used to switch the active fragment and a search bar which will be implemented in the future.

The estimated time for the task was way to short. I spent the estimated time spent to search how to implement a navigation bar and the search button and then about the same time to implement and test.

Next time, I will take into account the search time, even if it may be a lot easier than I think it is. So that I have time to take another task or review more code from pull request.

## Robin

I implemented an adapter from the Firebase class by Google. This adapter will be used to support the concept of user in the rest of the application, for example for permissions.

The estimated time was too low. I didn't predict that there will be many issues with the tests and the documentation.

Next time, I'll break the Product Backlog in smaller task and smaller branches.
