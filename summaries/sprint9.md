# Summary for week 9

## Alessio
This week, I implemented the ability for the admin to list all the events group by zone so that the admin can easily update or delete events, I also made some refactoring.

my time estimates were really good. 

Next week, I will work on the ability for the Activity provider to propose event creation and modification to the admin.

## Florian 
This week, I added the functionnality for an admin to accept or refuse a material request from an activity provider, and also to an activity provider to modify a pending item request.

My time estimates were great.

Next week, I will work on staff item deliveries, by adding the abitily to take item requests tasks and confirm the delivery.

## Mathieu

## Robin
This week, I fix bug #230 the edge dont conect to zone then I implemented Home page for each user type.

My time estimates were good.

Next week, I will work on the local cash for all route element.

## Stephane
This week, I implemented the bottom dialog fragment that is displayed on the map when you click on a zone to preview that zone's details as well as its upcoming events.

My time estimates were fairly good for this week's tasks. I've added some extra tasks to do if I have the time, like sorting the events in their starting time. But I ended up not doing them, instead I spent the rest of the time fixing a bug and adjusting according to the reviews I had on my PR.

Next week, I will implement the functionality to follow some events as well as notifications on events if I have the time.

## Overall team

This week, all team member finish their tasks on time. Florian and Mathieu work on a similar task and they manage to don't do the same work twice.

We had, two standup meetings, one on Monday and one on Wednesday. Nobody had noticeable problems.
